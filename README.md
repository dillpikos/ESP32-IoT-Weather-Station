# ESP32-IoT-Weather-Station
An ESP-32 IoT based embedded system that hosts it's own WiFi network using ESP32's Soft Access Point mode to display
real time weather and time data through a responsive web-based UI

# Project Overview
Fully functional prototype of an IoT embedded system built using the ESP-32 ands it Soft Access Point mode
to create it's own WiFi network allowing user's that are connected to access a web-page to monitor sensor data.

This system is designed to be simple, compact, and efficient where it doens't rely on being connected to an external WiFi network in order to display data.
I built this to further explore concepts of embedded systems along with the goal of broadening my expirence with different types of microcontrollers and their methods.

This systems displays weather and time realted data onto a web-page hosted by the ESP-32
